--Multiple Linear Regression--
* Dummy variable trap exists after performing a one Hot encoding on a categorical data which provides an n-bit representation of values with n categories. 
	eg: countrycolumn with3 categories (FR, US, UK) wil be rep as 001, 010, 101 etc. To avoid the dummy variable trap, always eliminate one of the n-new columns generated; usually the first of them.
